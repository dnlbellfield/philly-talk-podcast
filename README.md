## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google/Youtube API
Use CORS
Google APIs support CORS. If your application needs to do media uploads and downloads, it should use CORS. See the CORS Support page for details.

Supported environments
The JavaScript client library works with the same browsers supported by Google Apps except that mobile browsers are currently not fully supported. It only works within HTML documents with a <body> element served using the https (preferred) and http protocols. However, <iframe sandbox> elements and other restricted execution contexts are not supported.

Setup
Get a Google Account
First, sign up for a Google Account if you do not already have one.

Create a Google project
Go to the Google API Console. Click Create project, enter a name, and click Create.

Enable Google APIs
Next, decide which Google APIs your application needs to use and enable them for your project. Use the APIs Explorer to explore Google APIs that the JavaScript client library can work with.

To enable an API for your project, do the following:

Open the API Library in the Google API Console. If prompted, select a project or create a new one. The API Library lists all available APIs, grouped by product family and popularity.
If the API you want to enable isn't visible in the list, use search to find it.
Select the API you want to enable, then click the Enable button.
If prompted, enable billing.
If prompted, accept the API's Terms of Service.
Get access keys for your application
Google defines two levels of API access:

Level	Description	Requires:
Simple	API calls do not access any private user data	API key
Authorized	API calls can read and write private user data, or the application's own data	OAuth 2.0 credentials
To acquire an API key for simple access, do the following:
Open the Credentials page in the "APIs & Services" console.
Click Create credentials > API key and select the appropriate key type.
To keep your API keys secure, follow the best practices for securely using API keys.

To acquire OAuth 2.0 credentials for authorized access, do the following:
Open the Credentials page in the "APIs & Services" console.
Click Create credentials > OAuth client ID and select the appropriate Application type.
For information about using OAuth 2.0 credentials, see the Authentication page.


## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
